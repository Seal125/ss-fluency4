Using this link `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`, solve the following questions below. Make sure you use fetch, and
if you would like, you can use then() methods or use async/await. Whatever is easier for you! I would recommend using
async/await, however. Be sure to use high-order array methods for this as well!

1. Create a function, `getCompleted`, that returns those that have completed tasks.

2. Create a function, `getUncompleted`, that returns those that have uncompleted tasks.

3. Create a function, `userIdTasks`, that takes in a user ID and returns all of their tasks, both completed and uncompleted.

4. Create a function, `idTask`, that takes in an id and returns that task's title.

5. Create a function, `urgentTitle`, that returns all task titles with uppercase letters.


Now, using this link `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`, solve the following questions below. Same as before, use fetch!

6. Create a function, `getPost`, that takes in an id and returns that post.

7. Create a function, `userPosts`, that takes in a user ID and returns all the posts from that user.

8. Create a function, `longestTitle`, that returns the post with the longest title.

9. Create a function, `properTitle`, that returns the post's title but formatted properly. For example: "Eum Et Est Occaecati"
(notice how each starting letter in a word is uppercase!)

10. Create a function, `identify`, that returns an array with this format: "User (user's ID): (title)"
